# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a tool that is used to manage multiple version of source code edits that are then transferred to files on that platform.

Researched answer: Git an open source code platform edits, transferred files to a Git respository, GitHub serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git respository. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: true or false 

Researched answer: The Logical OR (II)(logical disjunction) operator for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. It is typcally with boolean (logical) values. When it is,it return a Boolean value. 

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index in typically an integer that is address within an ordered collection. 

Researched answer: Index notation is used to specify the elements of an array. Most current programming languages use square brackets [] as the array index operator. Older programming languages, such as FORTRAN, COBOL, and BASIC, often use parentheses () as the array index operator.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:An array is a collection of similar type of elements that are stored in a contiguous memory location. Arrays can contain primitives

Researched answer:The key difference between Array and String is that an Array is a data structure that holds a collection of elements having the same data types, while a String is a collection of characters.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: The objection of having two or more persons together on a project to work out.

Researched answer: Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
In mathematics and computer science, a higher-order function (HOF) is a function that does at least one of the following: takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e. a procedural parameter, which is a parameter of a procedure that is itself a procedure), returns a function as its result.

2. Jest: jest is a TypeScript preprocessor with source map support for Jest that lets you use Jest to test projects written in TypeScript.

3. Objects: An object is an instance which contains set of key value pairs. The values can be scalar values or functions or even array of other objects.

4. Method: In the TypeScript programming language, a method is a block of code, defined inside a class and only executed when being called. Methods divide a large task into small parts and perform the specific operation of that program. This process increases code reusability and enhances the program's modular approach.

5. Classes: 
In object-oriented programming languages like Java and C#, classes are the fundamental entities used to create reusable components. Functionalities are passed down to classes and objects are created from classes.
